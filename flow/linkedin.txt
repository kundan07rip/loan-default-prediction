🚀 Exciting Update! I've just completed a full end-to-end Machine Learning project: The Loan Default Prediction System! 🏦💡

In today's fast-paced world, banks need to make quick and accurate decisions on loan approvals. I built an AI-powered system that analyzes historical customer data—like credit utilization, repayment history, and demographic factors—to predict whether a borrower is at risk of defaulting on their loan next month. 

I broke the whole process down into 4 key phases:

🟡 Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
I worked with a real-world Credit Card Default dataset (30,000+ records), handling missing values, standardizing variations, and applying one-hot encoding to get the math ready for the algorithms.

🟡 Phase 2: Feature Engineering
This is where the magic happens! I engineered powerful custom indicators like 'Debt-to-Bill Ratio' and tracking severe delay trends to help the models uncover hidden patterns in borrower behavior. 

🟡 Phase 3: Model Training
I tested several robust algorithms including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, but the clear winner was XGBoost! The model acts as an expert "relay team", learning from past errors to produce highly accurate predictions, while adjusting for class imbalance.

🟡 Phase 4: Web Application Deployment
A model is only as good as its usability. So, I took the trained XGBoost model and deployed it into a clean, interactive web application using Streamlit! 
Anyone can now seamlessly input user metrics and get a real-time Risk Assessment (High/Low/Medium Risk), Although I am not into python devlopment so i took a little help from antigravity (GenerativeAI) 

Check out the workflow diagrams below that break down these 4 phases! 👇

I've documented the entire process, including code structure and ML principles, making it modular and reproducible. Let me know your thoughts in the comments!
